What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Command git init will create .git folder whitch allows me to use version control later. 
It needs to be done so Git could "know" it should treat a folder like a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

While working, I can put any files in the staging area which I think that belong
to one commit. Later, when I am ready to make a commit I can reevaluate my 
choices and remove or add some files before doing so.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I can add and remove files to staging area until I'm sure that I want to make
a commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

I can't think right now, because of the fucking tv.
