When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This is useful in many ways. I would obviously use remote repository when I'm working with other people, 
but I would use it anyway because it's goot to have copy of my files in the cloud if something gets
accidentally deleted or if I change the PC I'm currently working on.
